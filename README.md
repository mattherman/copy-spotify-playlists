# copy-spotify-playlists

Scripts for copying playlists between accounts using the Spotify API.

To run the scripts you will need an API token. The Spotify.TokenGenerator project is a web app that will allow you to authenticate with Spotify via OAuth and generate a token. To do so, run the application with `dotnet run` and then navigate to http://localhost:5000.
